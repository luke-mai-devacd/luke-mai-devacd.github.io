    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>

      I'm drawing a blank (and still am days later)
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I've always been a 'people first' person, no doubt thanks to the friends
      around me. (It's quite hard to put it into words.)
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      People. (Ironicly to an extent.) Even if I'm poor at articulation, I do
      pride myself on my wit. I might not be able to get my idea across but I
      won't bore you at least.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am HORRIBLE at articulating things (as you will see), especially
      emotional things (as you can see). I have this idea and it just
      jvmfoidsfhjosklfgsd ;-;. That and <i>focus.</i> I need to <i>FOCUS!</i>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In my LAR class, we had a group projdect where we had to pitch a made up
      company (like shark tank.) By we, I mean me. (my group couldn't present
      the idea since they didn't know what it was.) I should've asked the
      teacher for a group swap instead of pushing through myself, not fun.
