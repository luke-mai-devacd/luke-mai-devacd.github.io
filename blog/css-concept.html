      So, you want to know the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed
      positioning?

      <p style="font-size: smaller; color: gray">
        (Lucky for you, so do I, so I took a look.)
      </p>
      <h1>Starting with relative!</h1>
      <p>
        Anyway here's the rundown. So imagine that you have a friend called Joe
        who stands in one spot.
      </p>
      <p id="to-the-left">
        Then one day, he decides he'll be standing to the left a bit. A bit of
        what, well it's 'relative' to where he was before
      </p>
      <h1>NEXT UP: ABSOLUTE!</h1>
      <p>
        I'll try and explain this as best as I can, but I'm not a teacher.
        Absolute positions the element based on the nearest ancestor. Boxes are
        in boxes, it's positioned based on the box it's in. (Or the outside
        world in this analogy should it be out of the box.)
