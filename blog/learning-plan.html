    <h2>Q: What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>A: I want to be doing something I enjoy.</p>
    <h2>
      Q: A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning.
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: smaller; color: gray">(not a question but alright)</p>
    <p>
      A: I'd say I'm fairly good at picking things up quickly when I'm in 'the
      zone'. Sadly, it can be hard for me to get into that zone sometimes ;-;
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q: What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>There's no need to yell, I can hear you just fine.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: x-small">
      sorry. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p>A: The ability to articulate my ideas better would be nice.</p>
    <h2>
      Q: A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A: Somehow not a question and two questions at the same time. I'm not
      entierly sure on what 'safley' means in this conext. If your worried I'll
      hit someone, don't worry. For the second question, I'll try and use a
      pomodoro timer. (Been meaning to for a while.) try to use the pomodoro
      timer.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q: A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A: After five runs of the pomodoro timer without progress I'll ask for
      help in discord. (Will adjust as needed.)
    </p>
    <h2>Q: A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
    <p>
      A: Can I say food? Food and money. (kidding of course.) Speaking of
      courses, as long as they assist me in learning it'll be alright.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Q: Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p>A: Nothing I can think off.</p>
