      <h2>Q: What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        A: First, I’d like a job (crazy, I know. Really reaching for the
        unreachable goals here.) I’m not looking to make any impact in
        particular, though having time to work on my own projects would be nice.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Q: What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: Getting to know people and travelling might be a problem. (especially
        with weather like the one I’m currently writing in, though if winds kill
        me my student loan will be forgiven so there’s a silver lining at
        least.) As for strengths? I’m not sure. Though not a strength specific
        to me, having another eyes on a problem is always nice.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Q: What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
        will be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: Introductions (face to face). All goes well, I hit it off with
        everyone. I’m probably more nervous about this than it should be (sadly,
        recognizing this doesn’t seem to help.)
      </p>
      <h2>
        Q: What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: Articulation, specifically articulating issues or steps forward. That
        and feedback, I’d rather not just give thumbs up to everything but I’m
        worried about accidentally being rude or too harsh.
      </p>
      <h2>Q: What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>A: Teach me? That and give good feedback.</p>
      <h2>Q: What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        A: Gonna try and schedule all of my work once I get it instead of just
        ‘do as much as I can. It might be a good idea to write down
        reports(name-pending) in advance just in case someone asks how it’s
        going, instead of putting future-me on the spot.’

      <h2>Q: What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>A: I want to be doing something I enjoy.</p>
      <h2>
        Q: A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </h2>
      <p style="font-size: smaller; color: gray">
        (not a question but alright)
      </p>
      <p>
        A: I'd say I'm fairly good at picking things up quickly when I'm in 'the
        zone'. Sadly, it can be hard for me to get into that zone sometimes ;-;
      </p>
      <h2>
        Q: What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>There's no need to yell, I can hear you just fine.</p>
      <br />
      <p style="font-size: x-small">
        sorry. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p>A: The ability to articulate my ideas better would be nice.</p>
      <h2>
        Q: A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A: Somehow not a question and two questions at the same time. I'm not
        entierly sure on what 'safley' means in this conext. If your worried
        I'll hit someone, don't worry. For the second question, I'll try and use
        a pomodoro timer. (Been meaning to for a while.) try to use the pomodoro
        timer.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Q: A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: After five runs of the pomodoro timer without progress I'll ask for
        help in discord. (Will adjust as needed.)
      </p>
      <h2>Q: A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
      <p>
        A: Can I say food? Food and money. (kidding of course.) Speaking of
        courses, as long as they assist me in learning it'll be alright.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Q: Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p>A: Nothing I can think off.</p>
