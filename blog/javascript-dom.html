        <h2>ALRIGHT, LISTEN UP MAGGOTS!</h2>
        <p>
          I, lutenant [couldn't-come-up-with-a-nickname], have been ordered to
          teach you all about the Javas, the Scripts, and the Javascripts.
          Forget the first two.
        </p>
        <h2>Let's stahrt</h2>
        <p>You mean start?</p>
        <h2>I'm not running code through a spellchecker.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'll start by explaining how Javascript (JS from now on) used with
          HTML and CSS. If HTML is the bones, and CSS is the skin and clothing,
          then JS would be the organs. It does the math and makes your website
          even more interactable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Control Flows and Loops, what're those?</h2>
        <p>
          I like the enthusiasim me, or do you represent the hypothetical
          audience since you're asking?
        </p>
        <h2>Come back to it later, focus.</h2>
        <p>
          Right. Let's start with Loops. Loops let you make code run in a (take
          a guess). You can choose how long the loop goes on for (how long the
          code is run), what's in it (obviosuly), but you can also use the
          current loop number as a variable.
        </p>
        <h2>And control flows?</h2>
        <p>
          Right, almost forgot. Control flows is the order stuff happens in,
          kinda. (I'm not a teacher this isn't my forte). Normally it's top to
          bottom, but you can use things called 'Control structures' to change
          the order a bit. Let's use a real life example, let's say you have
          favroute food one up against the second best, favroute food two. And
          eating the food is running the code.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="background-color: green; color: black">
        if (Favfood == True) { CONSUME } else { CONSUME THE LESSER MEAL }
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        <h2>Ooh, very neat formatting.</h2>
        <p>
          Thank you. Anyway here you see you'd eat the first food if you had it
          (or if it was 'true'), else you'd resort to the second.
        </p>
        <h2>And next, the Document Object Model!</h2>
        <p>
          Right, the DOM (don't laugh), that's fairly important. I'll be honest,
          I'm still wrapping my head around what it is but I'm faiiiiirly sure I
          know how to use it.
        </p>
        <h2>Truely the profesional we need.</h2>
        <p>Silence, you may not speak for the rest of this blog.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So, the DOM, it lets JS edit the HTML (and CSS probably) just through
          code! You can think of it like a tree, starting at the 'doccument' it
          looks down the list given what it's been told (classes, id's, etc)
          until it finds what matches, then you can change it. Iiiii'll be
          honest, this is probably incorrect, a bit part about science
          communication is teaching something in a simple way just to get the
          base across, then expanding. I get a pass.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Right, they're gone, I'll do the intros. So, arrays and objects.
          Honestly at this point if I haven't boreded or wierded you away from
          reading more of my blog you're probably obligated to read it, I'll
          assume you know what variables are in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Array's are a list, simple right? You have thing one, thing two, thing
          three. Starts at zero in the code, dumb I know. And objects? They're
          like varibles that hold varibles, just how you could be John, and
          inside that include stuff like Age: 29, job: Botanist, etc etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The last part, functions! Ooh, this is simple! Functions are bits of
          code you cann call in later just by naming the function, as opposed to
          typing all the code at once again. Man, time flys when you're having
          fun, and this too forever.
