      <h2>I wonder if I'm allowed to swear in these..</h2>
      <p>
        Aaaaanyway, time for my problem solving blog! Let's start with the first
        question:
      </p>
      <h2>We're you blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
      <p>
        Probably. Most of the time it's simple spelling errors, but I assume
        there's a problem with my code first and at worst, rewrite parts I
        assume are breaking it. One time I forgot arrays start at zero, oof.
        ;-;.
      </p>
      <p>
        (I have since started reading error messages, so this doesn't happen
        that much anymore.)
      </p>
      <h2>What problem solving techniques do you use?</h2>
      <p>
        I've got a teddybear from my childhood on my desk, so I've started
        trying the rubber-ducky methood. (Though sometimes I forget about it.)
      </p>
      <h2>How do you feel about the process?</h2>
      <p>
        Fine enough. Bashing my head at the problem used to work well enoguh,
        but actually stepping back works better (and my head thanks me for it.)
      </p>
      <h2>How do you feel throughout the process?</h2>
      <p>
        Frustrated at the start most of the time. I set a timer and when it goes
        off if I'm too frustrated I <s>give up</s> step away for a moment and
        take a break.
      </p>
      <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not entierly sure how I should answer this one. I suppose every time
        I solve a problem I learn 'something', though I can't precieve it. It
        might be better to say I'm 'moulded'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br />
      <h2>How did I elegently solve a problem?</h2>
      <p>
        What does elegently even mean in this context? One time I solved
        something simple and struck a pose (there were people in the room, I was
        preforming), does that count? I really don't know what the question
        means-
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pseudocode, unconfident. Still wrapping my head around the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying something. Confident? It's hard to do anything without trying. If
        this means trying something new then does that count as problem solving?
        I feel like you have to try a solution no matter what technique you use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rubber ducky methood. Meh, it feels wierd but hopfully I get used to
        it/remember to do it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading error messages. Fairly confident now, used to forget they
        existed.
      </p>
      <p>Console.logging. Unconfident, I forget this exists all the time.</p>
      <p>
        Googling. Confident, this is easy. Don't know what a method does, look
        it up. MDN is nice if I'm feeling fancy, W3S if I'm feeling dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking your peers for help. I've written up help messages but never hit
        send since I'm too anxious ;-;. I get past the problem anyway so I guess
        I'm lucky in that sense.
      </p>
      <p>Asking coaches for help. Ditto.</p>
      <p>
        Improving your process with reflection. Unconfident, to say I have the
        memory of a goldfish would be an insult to goldfish.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        AAAAAAAAAlllll the time. I just feel dumb and it just feels icky. Idea,
        five minute timer, once I hit it the timer starts, every five minutes I
        roll a dice, lands on one or two, I press enter and ask for help.
