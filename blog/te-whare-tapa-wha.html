      <p>
        Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing): I try to go for a walk everyday, I'd
        increase the distance but that also increses the time and may mess with
        my schedule. I could attempt to jog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taha Wh훮nau (Family Wellbeing): One conversation with my voice once
        every two days. (I much prefer talking over text, meetings aren't my
        thing if you couldn't tell, but my voice is a use it or loose it thing
        so I should at least try to call my friends.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Taha Wh훮nau (Family Wellbeing): I try to distract myself often,
        attempting to make a change here probably won't end well for me so I'll
        keep it as it is until I'm not in an intensive course and can afford
        whatever happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing): Honestly, no clue. I used to be
        religous but not anymore. I could express gratatude and be thankfull to
        people but I've never understood thanking 'the universe'. That 20$ bill
        didin't land infront of you for a concious reason, it may as well be
        random, your gratatude is falling onto ears that don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment): I could go for
        beach walks.
