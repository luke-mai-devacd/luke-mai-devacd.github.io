        My reflection brings all the lads to the courtyard, they're like "It's
        probably comprable to yours."

      <h2>
        Q: What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: How nonuniform I am when writing (even if it should be a little
        formal), how hard it is for me to focus on introspection, how bad I am
        at remembering things.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Q: What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values and empathy, if you’re not working freelance then you don’t want
        to scare your work-partner off (and want to work well with them), if
        you’re working freelance you’ll probably want to stay on the good side
        of any clients.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Q: What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: What surprised me most about human skills learning is it’s focus on
        growth. I was expecting to learn more about how to stay in the right
        mindset (specifically for not getting stuck on errors) and working with
        others. (Not to suggest that focusing on growth is a bad thing, just
        wasn’t expected.)

      <h2>
        Q: What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>A: Doing the Human Skills learning ;-;.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Q: Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: I feel like this one has been answered for me, “Tech employers aren't
        looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code.
        They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the
        culture of their team.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Q: Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
        a waste of time?
      </h2>
      <p>Nope, not at all.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Q: Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
        Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A: Ehhhh no? (I want to say yes because programming practice is more
        fun, but without these skills it’s not like you can hold a career on
        practice alone, plus the growth focus helps with practice so it’s not
        like the two are entirely separated.)
