        Time to learn about Neuroplasticity (I hope not actually. if you're here
        to learn about it then yikes.)

        Making the first thing clear, I barely know what I'm talking about and I
        am tiiiired so I won't be doing any fun. As such I'll just be writing
        and checking boxes, (I finally implemented text-wrapping, yippie.) To
        start, how does knowing about nuroplasticity help? Easy enough, knowing
        the basics lets you change how your learning to take advantage of it,
        it's hard to change anything learning plan or learning plan adjacent
        without knowing what you're changing it into. Next, how might I "engage
        with the principles of neuroplasticity my your benefit." I'm not
        entierly sure actually, I'm sure I could find a code-practice
        thingymajig somewhere. "What are some of the ways to increase your
        neuroplasticity?" Practicing, instruments, languages maybe? Just
        challening your brain.

        Next, Growth mindset! Easy enough, thinking that you can't change makes
        it hard to change, it's a self fufilling phrophecy. I'll add the growth
        mindset thinking to my rubber band list, should I find myself thinking
        fixed thoughts, <i>snap</i>, a rubber band to the wrist snaps me out of
        it. Probably. Worth a shot.
