        I am obligated to tell you about what I have found through some
        research.

      <h2>Let's start with the difference between EQ and IQ.</h2>
      <p>
        If you say so. IQ stands for 'Intelligence quotient', and mesaures your
        cognative abilities. As opposed to EQ, (you can guess what it stands
        for, it's not hard), which measures your emotions. (How you nderstand
        them, manage them, read others emotions, etc.)
      </p>
      <h2>Ok cool, but why do I need it?</h2>
      <p>
        If you can't understand why you need EQ then you might need to work on
        your IQ.

        It's already starting to sound like a fake word, and we've only said
        them a few times.
