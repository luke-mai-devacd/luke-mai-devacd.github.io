      <p>I am obligated to tell you about what I have found through some research.</p>
      <h2>Let's start with the difference between EQ and IQ.</h2>
      <p>If you say so. IQ stands for 'Intelligence quotient', and mesaures your cognative abilities. As opposed to EQ, (you can guess what it stands for, it's not hard), which measures your emotions. (How you nderstand them, manage them, read others emotions, etc.)</p>
      <h2>Ok cool, but why do I need it?</h2>
      <p>If you can't understand why you need EQ then you might need to work on your IQ.</p>
      <h2>It's already starting to sound like a fake word, and we've only said them a few times.</h2>
      <p>'Said' in the vocalized sense or in the mention sense.</p>
      <h2>It's not like I'm typing this out with a microphone.</h2>
